<h4>Develop the practical coding skills you need to build Websites and Web apps.</h4>

<p>Its one thing to learn Html, Css, Javascript and Rails but before you can use them to build complex websites and web apps, you need to practice by building things.</p>

<p>As a beginner this can get frustrating very quickly because even if you know Html, Rails, etc. You dont have much experience using them to build things so even the simplest tasks become a chore...</p>

<p>When you join codetuts, you'll get a coding tutorial every week that involves building a complex website or web application. You'll follow along as we build the website/web app (explaining every step in great detail as we go along) and develop practcal coding skills in the process.</p>

<h1>Learn by Doing...</h1>
The problem with this is that As a beginner you dont really know how to build anything and when you try, it can get very frustrating very quickly.

Then you close the tutorial and try to re-build the application yourself.
